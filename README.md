    'Buddy',
    storage_adapter='chatterbot.storage.SQLStorageAdapter',
    database_uri='sqlite:///database.sqlite3'
)

 *Code Explanation:* 

This code creates an object of the ChatBot class from the chatterbot library.
• The ChatBot class is used to create chatbots that can engage in conversation with users.
• The first argument passed to the ChatBot constructor is the name of the chatbot, which is set to 'Buddy' in this case.
• The second argument, storage_adapter, specifies the type of storage adapter to use for storing the chatbot's training data and conversation history.
• In this case, the SQLStorageAdapter is used, which stores the data in a SQLite database.
• The third argument, database_uri, specifies the location of the SQLite database.
• In this case, the database is located in a file named database.sqlite3 in the current directory.

 # Create object of ChatBot class with Logic Adapter

)
     


CODE EXPLANATION: 



This code creates an instance of a chatbot using the ChatBot class from the chatterbot library.
• The chatbot is given the name "Buddy".
• The logic_adapters parameter is used to specify the logic adapters that the chatbot will use to generate responses.
• In this case, the chatbot will use two logic adapters: BestMatch and TimeLogicAdapter.
• The BestMatch adapter uses a combination of cosine similarity and Levenshtein distance to find the closest matching response to a given input.
• The TimeLogicAdapter adapter allows the chatbot to respond to questions about the current time.
• Overall, this code creates a chatbot instance with two logic adapters that will be used to generate responses to user input.



# Inport ListTrainer
from chatterbot.trainers import ListTrainer

trainer = ListTrainer(bot)

trainer.train([
'Hi',
'Hello',
'I need your assistance regarding my order',
'Please, Provide me with your order id',
'I have a complaint.',
'Please elaborate, your concern',
'How long it will take to receive an order ?',
'An order takes 3-5 Business days to get delivered.',
'Okay Thanks',
'No Problem! Have a Good Day!'
])
   


CODE EXPLANATION:





This code is using the ChatterBot library to train a chatbot using a ListTrainer.
• First, the ListTrainer is imported from the chatterbot.trainers module.
• Then, a trainer object is created by passing in the chatbot object as an argument.
• The trainer.train() method is called with a list of conversation pairs as an argument.
• Each pair consists of a user input and the corresponding response from the chatbot.
• The chatbot will use this training data to learn how to respond to similar inputs in the future.



List Trainer: [####################] 100%

CODE EXPLANATION:




This code snippet is not actually code, but rather a progress bar indicating the completion of a task.
• In this case, it is indicating that the "List Trainer" task has been completed with 100% progress.
• The "#" symbols represent the progress bar filling up as the task is completed.
• No specific programming language is specified in this snippet.



# Get a response to the input text 'I would like to book a flight.'
response = bot.get_response('I have a complaint.')

print("Bot Response:", response)


  

CODE EXPLANATION:




This code uses a chatbot to generate a response to a given input text.
• First, the get_response() method of the bot object is called with the input text "I have a complaint." as its argument.
• This method uses a natural language processing algorithm to analyze the input text and generate a response based on the chatbot's programming.
• The generated response is then stored in the response variable.
• Finally, the print() function is used to display the generated response in the console with the message "Bot Response:" preceding it.



Bot Response: Please elaborate, your concern
     


CODE EXPLANATION:

This code snippet is not actually code, but rather a message from a chatbot asking the user to provide more information about their concern.
• It is not written in any specific programming language, but rather in natural language.

        break
    else:
        response=bot.get_response(request)
        print('Bot:',response)




CODE EXPLANATION:

This code is written in Python and it creates a simple chatbot that interacts with the user.
• First, the code prompts the user to enter their name using the input() function and stores it in the name variable.
• Then, the code prints a welcome message using the print() function.
• Next, the code enters a while loop that will continue to run until the user enters "Bye" or "bye".
• Within the loop, the code prompts the user to enter a request using the input() function and stores it in the request variable.
• If the user enters "Bye" or "bye", the code prints a farewell message using the print() function and exits the loop using the break statement.
• Otherwise, the code passes the user's request to a chatbot (which is not shown in this code snippet) using the bot.get_response() function and stores the response in the response variable.
• Finally, the code prints the bot's response using the print() function.
• Overall, this code creates a simple chatbot that can interact with the user and respond to their requests.
